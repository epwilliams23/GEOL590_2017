### Visual rep of data

ggplot(weather.df,
       aes(x=time_hour, y= wind_speed))+
  geom_point()

### One data point stood out as an outlier as the speed was over 1200km/h

### filter point out by filtering windspeeds over 200

windspeed.df <- weather.df %>%
  group_by(wind_speed) %>%
  filter(wind_speed < 200)

  ### What direction has the highest median speed at each airport. 

  median_wind_speed <- weather.df %>% 
    na.omit(wind_dir)%>%                      ### removes N/A

### Plot of median wind speed at each airport
  
  ggplot(median_wind_speed, aes(x = wind_dir, y = median_wind_speed))+ 
    geom_point()+
    facet_wrap(~origin)
  
  ### Make a table with two columns: airline name and median distance flown from JFK airport.
  ### The table should be arranged in order of decreasing mean flight distance.

### Make a wide-format data frame that displays the number of flights that 
### leave Newark ("EWR") airport each month,from each airline

### Identify the ten most common male and female names in 2014. 
### Make a plot of their frequency (prop) since 1880. 


bn<- babynames

### top 10 female names

top_female_names2014<-bn%>%

### Make a plot of their frequency (prop) since 1880
 
  ### plot 10 female names ploted

    ###Determining the top names

female_names_plot <- bn %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  filter(name %in% top_female_names2014$name) %>%
  select(year,sex,name,prop) %>%
  group_by(name)

    ### PLoting the top names

ggplot(female_names_plot, 
       aes(x=year, y=prop, color=name))+
  geom_point()

### plot 10 male names ploted

    ###Determining the top names
male_names_plot <- babynames %>%

  filter(name %in% top_male_names2014$name) %>%
  select(year,sex,name,prop) %>%

### PLoting the top names

ggplot(male_names_plot, 
       aes(x=year, y=prop, color=name))+
         geom_point()




### Make a single table of the 26th through 29th most common girls names in the year 1896, 1942, and 2016

common<-bn%>%
  filter(year==1896 | year==1942 | year==2016, sex== "F" )%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  top_n(29,prop)%>%
  top_n(-4,prop)%>%
  print()


### I used the the nasaweather dataset and determined the average surface temperature
### and temp (dont really know what this is) during the month of January in the year 2000

head(nasaweather::atmos)

delta_temp<-nasaweather::atmos%>%
  filter(year==2000, month==1)%>%
  summarise(mean(surftemp), mean(temp))
